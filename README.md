# 🚀 **Iterative Learning for Manipulation and Grasping Against Unknown Resistance Fields**  
**Generalizable to Arbitrary Trajectories**  

This repository contains the implementation and supporting resources for the research paper:  
**"Iterative Learning for Manipulation and Grasping Against Unknown Resistance Fields that is Generalizable to Arbitrary Trajectories"**.  

---

## 📚 **About the Project**  

This project presents a novel **Iterative Learning Control (ILC)** framework designed to enable robotic manipulators to adapt and generalize control strategies across **unknown resistance fields** and **arbitrary trajectories**.  

Key contributions include:  
- 📊 **Direct and Safe Deployment:** No prior training required in simulations or hardware setups.  
- ⚡ **Rapid Learning:** Adaptation to new trajectories in just a few trials.  
- 💻 **Computational Simplicity:** Optimized for edge-device deployments.  
- 🤖 **Generalization Framework:** Transfer learned behaviors to new, unseen trajectories without extensive re-learning.  

### 🔑 **Core Components**
1. **Virtual System Integration:** Maps nonlinear robot dynamics into a linear virtual system.  
2. **Generalizable Learning:** Transfers learned control policies across arbitrary trajectories.  
3. **Trajectory Basis Learning:** Builds foundational trajectory knowledge to enable generalization.  
4. **Safety Mechanisms:** Prevents damage during unexpected resistance encounters.

## 🤖 **Applications**
1. **Material Cutting with Unknown Resistance:**  
   - Robot learns resistance characteristics of different materials (e.g., banana, cucumber).  
   - Demonstrates safe adaptation and halting upon encountering unexpected resistance.  

2. **Object Grasping with Unknown Properties:**  
   - Grasps objects with unknown mass and inertia properties.  
   - Transfers learned behaviors across arbitrary trajectories.
